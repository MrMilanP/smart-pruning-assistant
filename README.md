## 🔍 Idea Summary

This project discloses a concept for an Android mobile application designed to assist users in pruning fruit trees.

While walking around a tree (e.g. an apple tree), the user points their smartphone camera at the branches.  
The app uses machine learning (ML) to analyze the structure and shape of the tree — including common training shapes like "vase" or "conical" — and overlays **suggested cutting lines** directly on the screen, in real time, using AR (Augmented Reality).

The core idea was independently conceived by the author in Serbia without knowledge of any other similar system, and is now released publicly to:

- prevent exclusive patent claims over this general idea,
- support the open development of affordable pruning tools,
- allow others to build similar systems freely.

## 💡 Technical Flow (Concept Only)

1. User moves around the fruit tree with their phone.
2. The phone's camera captures multiple 2D images.
3. ML model (e.g. trained with labeled "vase shape" datasets) analyzes branch positions.
4. Suggested cut lines are computed and rendered **as overlays** on the camera feed.
5. No 3D reconstruction is required; detection works with 2D visual data only.
