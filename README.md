**Author**: Milan Petroviƒá  
**Initial concept date**: March 2025  
**Published as prior art**: April 21, 2025  
**License**: Apache 2.0

## üîç Idea Summary

This project discloses a concept for a mobile application designed to assist users in pruning fruit trees using **machine learning** and **augmented reality (AR)**.

While walking around a tree (e.g., apple tree), the user points their smartphone camera at the branches.  
The app uses ML to analyze the tree‚Äôs structure and overlays **suggested cutting lines** directly on the screen.

The core idea was independently conceived by the author in Serbia, without any prior knowledge of similar patent filings or commercial systems, and is now published to:

- prevent exclusive patent claims over this general idea,  
- support open development of accessible pruning tools,  
- allow anyone to build similar systems freely and legally.

## üí° Technical Flow (Concept Overview)

### 2D-Only Flow
1. User walks around the tree holding a phone.  
2. Camera captures a sequence of **2D images**.  
3. ML model (trained on labeled datasets) analyzes branch angles and form.  
4. Suggested cut lines are calculated and overlaid live on screen.  
5. **No 3D model** is required.

### Optional 3D Extension (Included in Prior Art)
1. Multiple 2D images are optionally used to reconstruct a 3D structure.  
2. ML model identifies key branch features (e.g., bifurcations, canes).  
3. Cut instructions are rendered over the 3D structure or camera feed.  
4. AR rendering synchronizes overlay with real-world visuals.
